## How to use it ##
To perform the tests you will need BioID database, that can be downloaded from:
https://www.bioid.com/About/BioID-Face-Database

After downloading the database, copy all the files from the BioID_annotations folder to the BioID pgm files folder. Then just compile the application, and run it with the database directory as an argument.
